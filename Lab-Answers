I choose creative commons-noncommercial because why I don'y mind someone viewing my data, it is as of yet unpublished.
Montana State University recommends followign the National Science Foundation guidelines for data management that includes open-source non-proprietary formats on public domains.
Yes, using GitHub would align with FAIR practices as long as I use open-source formats and make data publically avaialble.
The advantages of publically availabel data are it strengthens the scientific community because more peers can review your hypothesis, methods, data analysis, and results. Also, in the scientific community results should be reproducable which open-source facilitates. Lastly, GitHub as the added advantage of being a long-term repository so one peron's data can oinform anothers over time adding aiding in monotirng change.
I don't really see and disadvantages of open-source data as long as the the orginator of the data sets up GutHub well so that end-suers can navigate.
I would love to publish the results of my creasted wheatgrass revegetation project on GitHub. I already know several private and state/federal agencies chomping at the bit for my results.
I probably wouldn't publish anything that wasn't fully refined becasue this is a professional page and needs to relfect professionalism.
